# Colour Brain

A fun game that lets you test your colour memory as well as your ability to match Complementary, Triadic, Tetradic and Split-Complementary colours. 

## The build

- A fairly straightforward build that involves generating (almost) random colours and finding their respective complements etc.
- React router + framer-motion = a nice UI.
- Use of an external API to find the names of the colours generated (on the results page). A nice touch.

## Future plans

The business logic is all there as well as a preliminary design but it remains unpolished. I may rewrite the project in React Native as the game is better suited to mobile use (all of the feedback I've got is from phone users.)
